		<p><b>Kecak</b> (pronounced <i>[ˈketʃaʔ] ("Kechak")</i>, alternate spellings: <b><i>Kechak</b></i> and <b><i>Ketjak</b></i>), known in Indonesian as ,<i>Tari Kecak</i>, is a form of Balinese hindu dance and music drama that was developed in the 1930s in <a id="nav-jump" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali"> Bali</a>, Indonesia. Since its creation it has been performed primarily by men, with the very first women's kecak group starting in 2006. The dance mainly plays about the Ramayana and is traditionally performed in temples and villages across <a id="nav-jump" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali"> Bali</a>.</p>

		<p>Also known as the <strong>Ramayana Monkey Chant</strong>, the piece, performed by a circle of at least 150 performers wearing checked cloth around their waists, percussively chanting "chak" and moving their hands and arms, depicts a battle from the Ramayana. The monkey-like Vanara led by Hanuman helped Prince Rama fight the evil King Ravana. Kecak has roots in sanghyang, a trance-inducing exorcism dance.</p>
