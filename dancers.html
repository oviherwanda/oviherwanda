One individual is tasked for maintaining the beat of the chant with the chanting of "po-po-po", it is usually done by a single man. The other task is done by a man who become the leader of the chorus, he is tasked for instructing the chorus to stop or to start the chanting by yelling command vocals such as "Diih!", "Chiaaat!", etc. After that, there is the man who is tasked for singing during the chanting, he sings with a melodious and rhythmical tone according to the situation of the dance such as "Shiiir-yang-ngger-yang-nggur-yang-nggeer" and other melodies. Then, there is another man who become as the Dalang who is tasked to narrate the story during the dance usually in Balinese language and Sanskrit, he plays as the narrator of the performance. Men chosen for these tasks are usually the senior male dancers. The remaining chanters chant "chak-chak-chak" continuously and simultaneously with harmony.</p>
