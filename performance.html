		<h1>Performance</h1>
		<p>The Kecak dance is likely to be consists of about fifty to one hundred men wearing only loin-cloth, the upper part of their bodies are left bare. They form rows of circles, in the middle of which is a traditional Balinese coconut oil lamp. First they move their bodies rhythmically to the left and to the right, chanting the words "chak ke-chak ke-chak ke-chak" continuously, in slow rhythm. Gradually the rhythm is speeded up and by turns they lift their hands, trembling, into the air. The kecak dance is performed for dance-dramas and the story presented is taken from the Ramayana Hindu epic. The kecak dance is used to present the Ramayana dance-drama, the bare-chested male Kecak chanters play as Rama's troops of Vanaras (apes) and also as Ravana's troops of Rakshasas (giants).</p>

		<p>The duration of the performance is usually one hour and it depicts the story of the Ramayana from the point of Sita and Rama during their exile in the jungle of Dandaka. It then is followed by the appearance of the Golden Deer, the abduction of Sita by Ravana, the battle between Ravana and Jatayu, the search for Sita by Hanuman, and is ended by the battle between Rama and Ravana. The Kecak chanters in this stage chant and sing accordingly to the mood and milieu of the story taking part.</p>

		<p>Kecak dance performances in Bali usually take part daily in the evening (6 pm) at <a id="nav-jump" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balinese_temple">Balinese hindu</a> temples such as in Uluwatu Temple and Tanah Lot.
